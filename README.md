# sxrdcalc

sxrdcalc was developed to analyse the surface X-ray
diffraction data. It can be used to calculate X-ray diffraction
intensities from a surface layer, to calculate a Patterson map of
experimental data, and to fit a model structure to experimental data
using either a Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares fit or simulated
annealing.

## Requirement
C compiler (intel, GNU, etc. )  
GNU scientific library

## Install

Makefile is prepared for compiling sxrdcalc.
After editting Makefile, type "make".
