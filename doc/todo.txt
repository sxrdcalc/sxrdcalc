V. 1.2: 
OK - Add possibility to write comments in file 
OK - Write output file to stdout
OK- Add calculation for same h, k ,l as in data file
OK - read Debye-Waller factor
OK - don't calculate bulk positions
- add space group p3m1 (for SiC 3x3)

V. 2.0
OK - User-supplied starting values for parameters
- GSL error handling
- Check chi^2 / dof
- Calculate scale at beginning of fit
- Different atom types allowed (atom_scattering_f in loop over atoms...)
OK - electron difference maps
OK - ARE f AND df OKAY??? OR SHOULD BE LIKE SQUARE OF CURRENT FUNCTION?
OK - IS DEFINITION AND USE OF SIGMA IN FIT CONSISTENT?????
OK - Add domain occupancy in ls_fit_f, ls_fit_df (for summation over domains)
OK - scale of electron difference maps
OK - Scattering length, Debye-Waller factor correct?
- Simulated annealing: Different step length for positions, Debye-Waller parameter.
- Change name of scattering length?
